This is sample app to practice my react and coding skill.

I used the following technologies
 - React, html, CSS
 - greedy algorithm to assign roster on a first come first serve basis. 
 - deployed to AWS via clickops :( 

## Run Locally

1. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`
2. Run the app:
   `npm run dev`
